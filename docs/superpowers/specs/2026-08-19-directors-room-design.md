# Directors Room Promotion and Reliability Design

**Date:** 2026-08-19  
**Status:** Approved for specification review  
**Scope:** Promote the existing storyboard studio into the single canonical Directors Room web experience.

## Product identity

Aurora has one Directors Room product surface:

- `/director-room` is the canonical functional workspace.
- `/directors-board` remains a compatibility entry point and redirects to `/director-room`.
- Navigation, page copy, and visible labels use **Director Room** consistently.
- Existing API paths containing `directors-board` remain internal implementation names in this release. They are not a second product surface.
- Every image generation initiated from Director Room uses the Replit AI Integrations image provider, billed to the workspace's Replit credits. The normal Aurora Aura charge remains in place for the user.
- No new web artifact or second mobile app is created for this work. “Builds” means the feature implementation plus development, production, and end-to-end verification.

The existing Android AAB remains a separate release track.

## Existing foundation

The implementation extends the current storyboard studio rather than replacing it:

- `StudioPage` owns the workspace shell and board interactions.
- `FlowCanvas` and `Timeline` provide the shot graph and ordered sequence.
- `Inspector` edits a shot, uploads a frame, and generates a still.
- `CharactersPanel` manages cast references and generates character sheets.
- `DirectorChat` streams suggestions and accepts proposed shots.
- `VideoAgentPanel` queues render jobs and polls their terminal state.
- `WorkersPanel` exposes GPU worker status.
- `board-store` owns the board model and browser persistence.
- `render-jobs` owns the Supabase render-job boundary.

## Routing design

1. Make the `/director-room` lazy route render the existing `StudioPage`.
2. Move the current marketing-only Director Room content out of the functional route. Product messaging can remain in navigation or a separate marketing surface, but `/director-room` must open the workspace.
3. Change `/directors-board` to a compatibility redirect using the existing router conventions. It must not load a second studio implementation.
4. Update visible navigation and internal calls-to-action that still identify the product as Directors Board.
5. Preserve existing API route names unless a caller contract requires a deliberate alias or migration.

## Workspace and data flow

### Board state

The board remains the source of truth for this release and continues to persist to `localStorage`:

- The existing board ID remains stable for the lifetime of the board and is passed to render jobs.
- Board edits, accepted proposals, generated still URLs, and completed video URLs update board state immediately.
- The UI continues to state that the board is saved to the current browser. Cross-device/server-persisted projects are explicitly out of scope.

### Director collaboration

`DirectorChat` continues to use the streaming Directors Board chat endpoint:

- It sends the current ordered board context.
- A proposal is not applied automatically.
- Accepting a proposal adds a shot, selects it, and returns focus to the canvas.
- Later prompts see the updated board context.

### Still generation

Inspector and character-sheet generation use one intentional Directors Room image contract:

- Align callers with the supported Directors Room image endpoint rather than leaving Inspector and Characters on a potentially dead `/api/generate-image` path while the route-specific endpoint is `/api/directors-board/generate-image`.
- Pin the image request to the existing Replit Gemini image adapter (`replit/gemini-2.5-flash-image`) so the provider cost is billed to Replit credits.
- Continue reserving/charging the user's Aurora Aura through the normal app-level generation flow.
- Do not fall through to Pollinations, fal, Runware, GPU workers, or another external image provider if the Replit image adapter is unavailable; return an explicit provider error instead.
- Preserve `streamImage` support for either a JSON URL response or an SSE response.
- Only save a URL after a valid final image result.
- Keep partial previews local to the active panel until completion.
- Map credit exhaustion, rate limiting, missing output, provider failures, and malformed responses to visible actionable errors.
- After success, the URL must remain visible when switching tabs and after reloading the same browser.

### Video generation

Video nodes continue to use the existing render-job and GPU-worker contracts:

- Queue requests include board ID, shot ID, model, prompt, optional still input, duration, and FPS.
- The selected shot stores the created job ID and clears stale video output when a new job starts.
- Polling is scoped to the selected shot, cleans up on unmount, and stops on `completed`, `failed`, or a polling error.
- A completed output URL is written back to the shot and rendered in the inspector.
- Queue, worker, and provider failures remain visible in the video panel.
- Duplicate queue submissions are disabled while a request is active.

### Export

ZIP export remains a board-level action:

- It exports the current board and available generated media.
- It reports missing or failed media explicitly instead of silently presenting an apparently complete archive.
- Export controls show a busy state and cannot be submitted twice concurrently.

## Reliability and error handling

- Preserve provider error text sufficiently for existing Aurora toast/error classification.
- Every asynchronous action has a visible loading state and a visible failure state.
- Do not write blank or stale URLs after failed/partial responses.
- Polling timers and streaming readers are cleaned up when the active component changes or unmounts.
- Chat, image generation, render queueing, and export prevent duplicate submissions while busy.
- The canonical room must remain usable when one generation surface fails; an image failure must not disable the board, and a video-job failure must not hide existing stills.
- Replit image-provider failure must not silently spend on or switch to another provider.
- No silent fallback to a different product route or second studio is permitted.

## Verification plan

Verification must confirm visible behavior, not only HTTP success:

1. Open `/director-room` and confirm the workspace visibly renders.
2. Open `/directors-board` and confirm it lands on the same canonical room.
3. Verify desktop and mobile layout behavior for canvas, inspector, chat, characters, and GPU tabs.
4. Verify a streamed Director response can produce a proposal and accepting it creates/selects a shot.
5. Verify still-generation success and failure states for a shot and character sheet.
6. Verify queueing, polling, terminal success, and terminal failure for a video node.
7. Verify ZIP export busy/success behavior and explicit handling of missing/failed media.
8. Run the relevant typecheck, lint, unit/MCP tests, Playwright tests, and production web build.
9. Restart the relevant workflow after changes, inspect logs, and capture a final preview.

## Scope boundaries

This release does not include:

- a second Directors Room route or artifact,
- server-persisted boards or projects,
- a new mobile Directors Room implementation,
- finishing, lipsync, or Aurora Soul work,
- a new Android AAB.

Those can be planned separately after the canonical web room is reliable.
