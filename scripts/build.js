// Production build entry point invoked by the Replit autoscale deployer.
// The deployer calls `node scripts/build.js` as its cached build command —
// that contract must not change. artifacts/web's production.build also
// delegates here via scripts/replit-node.sh.
//
// Onion layers (see docs/BACKUP_AND_DR.md):
//   1. After a successful vite build, .output is snapshotted to
//      .build-snapshots/snapshots/<ts>-<sha> and the `current` candidate
//      pointer is moved (with bounded rotation).
//   2. A post-build health gate boots the fresh snapshot and probes
//      /api/health; only a healthy build moves the `last-known-good` pointer.
//   3. A gate failure FAILS THE BUILD, so a build that compiles but cannot
//      boot is never deployed — the previously deployed instance keeps
//      serving, and the start-time guard (scripts/start-prod.sh) keeps a
//      restorable snapshot underneath everything.
